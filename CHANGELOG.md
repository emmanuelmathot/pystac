## [v0.4.0]

The two major changes for this release are:
- Upgrade to STAC 0.9.0
- Refactor the extensions API to accomidate items that implement multiple extesions (e.g. `eo` and `view`)

See the [stac-spec 0.9.0 changelog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/v0.9.0/CHANGELOG.md) and issue [#65](https://github.com/azavea/pystac/issues/65) for more information.

### API Changes

These are the major API changes that will have to be accounted for when upgrading PySTAC:

#### Extensions are wrappers around Catalogs, Collection and Items, and no longer inheret.

This change affects the two extensions that were implemented for Item - `EOItem` and `LabelItem`
have become `EOItemExt` and `LabelItemExt`, and no longer inheret from Item.

This change was motivated by the 0.9 change that split some properties out from `eo` into
the `view` extension. If we kept an inheritance-based extension architecture, we would not
be able to account well for these new items that implemented both the `eo` and `view` extensions.

See the [Extensions section](https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/0.4/concepts.html#extensions) in the
documentation for more information on the new way to use extensions.

#### Extensions have moved to their own package:
- `pystac.label` -> `pystac.extensions.label`
- `pystac.eo` -> `pystac.extensions.eo`
- `pystac.single_file_stac` -> `pystac.extensions.single_file_stac`

### Added

- `pystac.read_file` as a convenience function for reading in a STACObject from a file at a URI which delegates to `STACObject.from_file`.
- `pystac.read_file` as a convenience function for reading in a STACObject from a file at a URI.
- Added support for the [view](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/view) extension.
- Added support for the [commons](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/commons) extension.

### Changed
- Migrated CI workflows from Travis CI to GitHub Actions [#108](https://github.com/azavea/pystac/pull/108)
- Dropped support for Python 3.5 [#108](https://github.com/azavea/pystac/pull/108)

- Extension classes for label, eo and single-file-stac were moved to the `pystac.extensions` package.
- the eo and label extensions changed from being a subclass of Item to wrapping items. __Note__: This is a major change in the API for dealing with extensions. See the note below for more information.
- Renamed the class that enumerates extension names from `Extension` to `Extensions`
- Asset properties always return a dict instead of being None for Assets that have non-core properties.
- The `Band` constructor in the EO extension changed to taking a dict. To create a band from property values,
use `Band.create`
